### Introduction to our project:
The e-commerce business sees an exponential trend, and 2023 sees the highest revenue for the business so far - at almost 12 million dollars. Within Product analysis, an extensive dataset showcases 26 distinct categories and 2755 unique brands, encapsulating a diverse array of 27,230 individual products. Notably, sales dominance is found in categories such as Intimates, Jeans, and Tops & Tees. Remarkably, Jeans emerged as the revenue champion, bring in 17,679 units' transaction, which makes up for $1.7 million in revenue and 0.8 million dollars in profit. The Marketing department unveiled crucial demographic insights, such as high-value customer segments in China, the United States, and Brazil, primarily aged between 35 and 64. Traffic analytics showcased Email and Adwords as top traffic generators, while YouTube and Organic traffic channels exhibited superior conversion rates. Noteworthy was the customer journey, typically concluding in around 14 clicks or an average of 7.4 hours before clicking into the purchase page. Operations showcased improved shipping efficiency since 2019, although with outlier shipping speeds for countries such as Columbia. Additionally, a satisfying level of inventory levels and profitability across most categories is observed, emphasizing the operational success that the company should continue.
